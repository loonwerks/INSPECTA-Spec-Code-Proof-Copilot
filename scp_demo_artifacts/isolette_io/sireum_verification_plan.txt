- Run the following verification steps in order. 

Step 1- Regenerate artifacts from the SysML model ( default to JVM unless instructed by user to use Microkit).
  For JVM:
     isolette/sysml/bin/run-hamr.cmd JVM

  For Microkit:
     isolette/sysml/bin/run-hamr.cmd Microkit

Expected Behavior:

- HAMR updates generated contract regions in Slang components
- HAMR preserves developer-written application logic
- Slang artifacts are written to:
    
    isolette/hamr/slang

Step 2- Verify code level contracts use:
    
    isolette/hamr/slang/bin/run-logika.cmd

Step 3- Check model level intergration constraints use:
   sireum hamr sysml logika --sourcepath isolette/sysml

  
- VERY IMPORTANT: After applying a step, if it fails or produces any error messages, explain the errors, suggest a repair plan, and wait for my approval before continuing.
 
- Also, if approved by user, if it Fails → For this test plan, keep the application logic in slang and the SysML v2 specification unchanged. Modify only the GUMBO contracts (following Gumbo_FSE_agent_plan.txt), then return to Step 1 of this plan above, (i.e. rerun sireum_verification_plan.txt

- If it succeeds and there are more steps, move to the next step. If the final step succeeds, report the verification status from Logika and ask me what to do next.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes & Guardrails
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Do NOT edit HAMR-generated contract blocks
- Place all application logic in developer regions
- Regeneration relies on delimiters to safely update contracts
