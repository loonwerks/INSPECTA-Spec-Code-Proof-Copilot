SCP META-RULES ADAPTATION RISK–MITIGATION MAPPING
@Amer Tahat, Jan 2026
======================================================================
PURPOSE
======================================================================

This document identifies key technical and programmatic risks associated
with the SCP Supervised Meta-Rules Adaptation framework and maps each
risk to explicit mitigation mechanisms embedded in the design, execution
plan, and assurance case.

The intent is to demonstrate that identified risks are actively managed
rather than assumed away.

======================================================================
RISK R1: UNCONTROLLED OR REGRESSIVE ADAPTATION
======================================================================

Description:
Meta-Rule adaptation could introduce regressions, semantic drift, or
undesirable behavior over successive iterations.

Potential Impact:
- Degradation of formal specifications
- Loss of system correctness
- Reduced trust in automated adaptation

Mitigation:
- Strict monotonic acceptance rules (epsilon-bounded cosine distance)
- Mandatory system-level and code-level verification gates
- Explicit rejection of non-improving candidates
- Persistent checkpointing and rollback capability

Evidence:
- Acceptance rule definition
- Verification logs
- Checkpoint history showing monotonic improvement

======================================================================
RISK R2: OPAQUE OR NON-AUDITABLE LEARNING
======================================================================

Description:
Adaptation mechanisms could operate as black boxes, making it difficult
to inspect, certify, or explain learned behavior.

Potential Impact:
- Reduced customer/user confidence
- Certification barriers
- Inability to justify design decisions

Mitigation:
- Externalization of learned behavior into human-readable Meta-Rules
- Version-controlled rule books
- Explicit acceptance criteria and human approval gates

Evidence:
- Meta-Rule artifacts
- Rule book version history
- Human approval records

======================================================================
RISK R3: OVER-SPECIALIZATION (OVERFITTING)
======================================================================

Description:
Meta-Rules induced from golden examples may become overly specific to
a single system instance or requirement set.

Potential Impact:
- Poor transferability to new systems
- Limited reuse of learned rules

Mitigation:
- Cosine-distance thresholds designed to avoid trivial memorization
- Epsilon tuning to encourage semantic similarity without identity
- Human expert review focused on generality and abstraction quality

Evidence:
- Distance metrics showing bounded similarity
- Human review annotations
- Cross-contract evaluation results

======================================================================
RISK R4: UNDER-CONSTRAINED GENERALIZATION
======================================================================

Description:
Meta-Rules may be overly general, producing ambiguous or weak contracts
that pass semantic checks but fail verification.

Potential Impact:
- Increased verification failures
- Reduced precision of generated contracts

Mitigation:
- Mandatory formal verification as a hard acceptance gate
- Greedy salvage strategy retaining only verifiable improvements
- Rejection of unverifiable candidate Meta-Rules

Evidence:
- Verification failure logs
- Accepted vs. rejected Meta-Rule comparisons

======================================================================
RISK R5: DEPENDENCE ON CONTEXT WINDOW LIMITATIONS
======================================================================

Description:
Meta-Rules must currently be supplied within the model’s context window
at execution time, constraining scale and complexity.

Potential Impact:
- Execution limits for large rule sets
- Performance degradation with long contexts

Mitigation:
- Intentional design choice favoring auditability over opaque persistence
- Rule modularization and scoped activation
- Alignment with trends toward larger context windows and improved
  long-horizon reasoning in foundation models

Evidence:
- Modular Meta-Rule structure
- Execution traces demonstrating feasibility within current contexts

======================================================================
RISK R6: HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP BOTTLENECK
======================================================================

Description:
Human approval requirements may introduce latency or scalability limits.

Potential Impact:
- Reduced automation throughput
- Increased operational cost

Mitigation:
- Human approval applied only at acceptance checkpoints
- Automation of synthesis, evaluation, and verification steps
- Metrics collected to quantify and optimize human intervention rates

Evidence:
- Progress logs with intervention counts
- Efficiency metrics over successive iterations

======================================================================
RISK R7: LIMITED DOMAIN GENERALIZABILITY
======================================================================

Description:
Meta-Rules validated on one system (e.g., Isolette) may not generalize
to structurally different domains.

Potential Impact:
- Reduced applicability beyond initial case studies

Mitigation:
- Planned evaluation on additional domains (e.g., firewall and
  security-policy systems)
- Controlled reuse of Meta-Rules with domain-specific adaptation
- Preservation of domain-specific vs. domain-agnostic rules

Evidence:
- Cross-domain evaluation plans
- Rule classification and reuse analysis

======================================================================
SUMMARY
======================================================================

Each identified risk is mitigated through explicit design choices,
quantitative acceptance criteria, formal verification, and human
governance. Collectively, these mitigations ensure that Supervised
Meta-Rules Adaptation remains controlled, auditable, and suitable for
high-assurance system development contexts.
