Goal–Strategy–Evidence (GSE) Structure

======================================================================
ASSURANCE CASE INTENT
======================================================================

This assurance case provides a structured argument that the
SCP Supervised Meta-Rules Adaptation framework provides a controlled,
verifiable mechanism for evolving formal translation logic without
relying on black-box model fine-tuning.

The assurance case is intended to be:
- Reviewable by customer/user and external stakeholders, and
- Executable in intent by an automated Codex-style agent following the
  associated SCP_Cosine_Meta_Rules_Adaptation_Plan.txt.

======================================================================
TOP-LEVEL GOAL (G0)
======================================================================

G0: The SCP Copilot Supervised Meta-Rules Adaptation framework enables
    controlled evolution of formal translation logic by crystallizing
    ephemeral in-context learning behaviors into persistent, expert-
    curated Meta-Rules, thereby driving a verifiable generate–verify–
    repair loop that translates English requirements into GUMBO
    contracts and HAMR-generated code while preserving system
    correctness, verification soundness, and human governance.

This approach serves as a verifiable surrogate for black-box weight
adaptation, effectively circumventing data scarcity and proprietary
constraints that prohibit fine-tuning state-of-the-art models.

======================================================================
STRATEGY (S0)
======================================================================

S0: Argue G0 by demonstrating that:

    (1) Meta-Rule adaptations monotonically improve semantic alignment
        with authoritative specifications,
    (2) All preserved adaptations maintain system- and code-level
        correctness under formal verification, and
    (3) Only candidate adaptations that satisfy quantitative metrics
        and human approval are crystallized into the persistent rule
        book.

This strategy is decomposed into three subordinate goals.

======================================================================
SUBGOAL 1: SEMANTIC AND BEHAVIORAL IMPROVEMENT
======================================================================

G1: Meta-Rule adaptations monotonically improve the semantic quality and
    behavioral fidelity of generated GUMBO contracts relative to a
    golden reference specification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY (S1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

S1: Enforce quantitative acceptance criteria over candidate Meta-Rule
    modifications using embedding-based cosine distance and auxiliary
    efficiency metrics.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EVIDENCE (E1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

E1.1: Baseline cosine distance measurements between generated contracts
      and golden reference texts.

E1.2: Candidate cosine distance measurements demonstrating monotonic
      improvement bounded by epsilon.

E1.3: Recorded efficiency improvements (e.g., reduced token usage or
      verification runtime) where applicable.

E1.4: Logs demonstrating rejection of non-improving or regressive
      Meta-Rule candidates.

======================================================================
SUBGOAL 2: FORMAL VERIFICATION PRESERVATION
======================================================================

G2: All Meta-Rule adaptations preserved into the rule book preserve
    system-level and code-level correctness as established by formal
    verification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY (S2)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

S2: Require that every candidate Meta-Rule adaptation pass integration-
    level and code-level Logika verification prior to acceptance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EVIDENCE (E2)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

E2.1: Successful Logika verification results for models generated using
      accepted Meta-Rules.

E2.2: Verification failure logs demonstrating that candidates violating
      correctness properties are rejected.

E2.3: Recorded verification runtimes and token usage supporting
      repeatable execution.

======================================================================
SUBGOAL 3: SUPERVISED GOVERNANCE AND RULE CRYSTALLIZATION
======================================================================

G3: Meta-Rule adaptation is supervised, auditable, and resistant to
    uncontrolled drift or regression.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY (S3)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

S3: Treat each Meta-Rule modification as a candidate hypothesis that is
    preserved into the persistent rule book only if all acceptance
    conditions are satisfied.

Acceptance conditions include:
- Quantitative improvement (cosine distance and/or efficiency metrics),
- Successful formal verification, and
- Explicit human approval.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EVIDENCE (E3)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

E3.1: Formal acceptance rules defining epsilon-bounded improvement and
      auxiliary metric thresholds.

E3.2: Checkpoint history showing only approved Meta-Rule candidates are
      committed to the rule book.

E3.3: Human approval records associated with preserved adaptations.

E3.4: Progress logs demonstrating that rejected candidates are not
      persisted.

======================================================================
CONTEXT AND ASSUMPTIONS (C)
======================================================================

C1: Fine-tuning of foundation models is infeasible due to data scarcity,
    cost, or proprietary constraints ( e.g., restricted by LLM vendors).

C2: Meta-Rules provide a stable abstraction layer for capturing expert
    knowledge and learned translation behavior.

C3: Embedding-based cosine distance is an appropriate proxy for semantic
    alignment at the contract level.

C4: Logika verification accurately reflects system- and code-level
    correctness properties.

======================================================================
JUSTIFICATION (J)
======================================================================

J1: Supervised Meta-Rule Adaptation provides stronger assurance than
    black-box fine-tuning by preserving transparency, auditability, and
    deterministic rollback.

J2: Crystallizing successful in-context learning behaviors into 
    persistent Meta-Rules enables cumulative learning in mainstream 
    LLMs without explicit weight modification, effectively circumventing
    the cost and operational constraints of base model fine-tuning, while
    still achieving significant improvements in translation accuracy,
    verification success rates, and execution efficiency.

    This enables high-assurance adaptation in environments where
    fine-tuning is infeasible, prohibited, or non-certifiable, without
    sacrificing performance.    

======================================================================
CONCLUSION
======================================================================

Given satisfaction of G1, G2, and G3, G0 is supported: the SCP Copilot
Supervised Meta-Rules Adaptation framework provides a verifiable,
governed alternative to fine-tuning, GPT 5.1 max and GPT 5.2 max models, 
that enables self-healing formal translation from English requirements 
to GUMBO contracts and HAMR code, while maintaining correctness 
guarantees and human control.
