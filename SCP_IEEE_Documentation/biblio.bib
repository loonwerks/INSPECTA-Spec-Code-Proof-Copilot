  ABSTRACT     = {
Program termination verification is a challenging research subject of
significant practical importance. While there is already a rich body
of literature on this subject, it is still undeniably a difficult task
to design a termination checker for a realistic programming language
that supports general recursion.  In this paper, we present an
approach to program termination verification that makes use of a form
of dependent types developed in Dependent ML (DML), demonstrating a
novel application of such dependent types to establishing a liveness
property. We design a type system that enables the programmer to
supply metrics for verifying program termination and prove that every
well-typed program in this type system is terminating.  We also
provide realistic examples, which are all verified in a prototype
implementation, to support the effectiveness of our approach to
program termination verification as well as its unobtrusiveness to
programming. The main contribution of the paper lies in the design of
an approach to program termination verification that smoothly combines
types with metrics, yielding a type system capable of guaranteeing
program termination that supports a general form of recursion
(including mutual recursion), higher-order functions, algebraic
datatypes, and polymorphism.}

{A generalisation of Milner's `LCF approach' is described. This allows
algorithms based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to be programmed
as derived proof rules in a calculus of representation judgements. The
derivation of representation judgements becomes an LCF-style proof by
defining an abstract type for judgements analogous to the LCF type of
theorems. The primitive inference rules for representation judgements
correspond to the operations provided by an efficient BDD package
coded in C (BuDDy). Proof can combine traditional inference with steps
inferring representation judgements. The resulting system provides a
platform to support a tight and principled integration of theorem
proving and model checking. The methods are illustrated by using them
to solve all instances of a generalised Missionaries and Cannibals
problem.}

  ABSTRACT = {Motivated by applications to proof assistants based on dependent
types, we develop and prove correct a strong reducer and
$\beta$-equivalence checker for the $\lambda$-calculus with products,
sums, and guarded fixpoints.  Our approach is based on compilation to
the bytecode of an abstract machine performing weak reductions on
non-closed terms, derived with minimal modifications from the ZAM
machine used in the Objective Caml bytecode interpreter, and
complemented by a recursive ``read back'' procedure.  An
implementation in the Coq proof assistant demonstrates important
speed-ups compared with the original interpreter-based implementation
of strong reduction in Coq.}

  ABSTRACT = {We study the problem of certifying programs combining 
  imperative and functional features within the general framework of
  type theory.  Type theory constitutes a powerful specification
  language, which is naturally suited for the proof of purely
  functional programs. To  deal with imperative programs, we propose 
  a logical interpretation of an annotated program as a partial proof 
  of its specification. The construction of the corresponding partial 
  proof term is based on a static analysis of the effects of the
  program, and on the use of monads. The usual notion of monads is
  refined in order to account for the notion of effect. The missing subterms
  in the partial proof term are seen as proof obligations, whose actual 
  proofs are left to the user. We show that the validity of those proof 
  obligations implies the total correctness of the program.
  We also establish a result of partial completeness.
  
  This work has been implemented in the Coq proof assistant.
  It appears as a tactic taking an annotated program as argument and
  generating a set of proof obligations. Several nontrivial
  algorithms have been certified using this tactic.}

  ABSTRACT     = {
Program termination verification is a challenging research subject of
significant practical importance. While there is already a rich body
of literature on this subject, it is still undeniably a difficult task
to design a termination checker for a realistic programming language
that supports general recursion.  In this paper, we present an
approach to program termination verification that makes use of a form
of dependent types developed in Dependent ML (DML), demonstrating a
novel application of such dependent types to establishing a liveness
property. We design a type system that enables the programmer to
supply metrics for verifying program termination and prove that every
well-typed program in this type system is terminating.  We also
provide realistic examples, which are all verified in a prototype
implementation, to support the effectiveness of our approach to
program termination verification as well as its unobtrusiveness to
programming. The main contribution of the paper lies in the design of
an approach to program termination verification that smoothly combines
types with metrics, yielding a type system capable of guaranteeing
program termination that supports a general form of recursion
(including mutual recursion), higher-order functions, algebraic
datatypes, and polymorphism.}

                  abstract = { This thesis deals with machine-checking
                  a large sublanguage of sequential Java, covering
                  nearly all features, in particular the
                  object-oriented ones. It shows that embedding such a
                  language in a theorem prover and deducing
                  practically important properties is meanwhile
                  possible and explains in detail how this can be
                  achieved. We formalize the abstract syntax, and the
                  static semantics including the type system and
                  well-formedness conditions, as well as an
                  operational (evaluation) semantics of the
                  language. Based on these definitions, we can express
                  soundness of the type system, an important design
                  goal claimed to be reached by the designers of Java,
                  and prove that type safety holds indeed. Moreover,
                  we give an axiomatic semantics of partial
                  correctness for both statements and (side-effecting)
                  expressions. We prove the soundness of this
                  semantics relative to the operational semantics, and
                  even prove completeness. We further give a small but
                  instructive application example. A direct outcome of
                  this work is the confirmation that the design and
                  specification of Java (or at least the subset
                  considered) is reasonable, yet some omissions in the
                  language specification and possibilities for
                  generalizing the design can be pointed out. The
                  second main contribution is a sound and complete
                  Hoare logic, where the soundness proof for our Hoare
                  logic gives new insights into the role of type
                  safety. To our knowledge, this logic is the first
                  one for an object-oriented language that has been
                  proved complete. By-products of this work are a new
                  general technique for handling side-effecting
                  expressions and their results, the discovery of the
                  strongest possible rule of consequence, and a new
                  rule for flexible handling of mutual recursion. All
                  definitions and proofs have been done fully formally
                  with the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL,
                  representing one of its major applications. This
                  approach guarantees not only rigorous definitions,
                  but also gives maximal confidence in the results
                  obtained. Thus this thesis demonstrates that
                  machine-checking the design of an important
                  non-trivial programming language and conducting
                  meta-theory on it entirely within a theorem proving
                  system has become a reality. } }

  abstract = {Mixed-criticality systems (MCS) combine real-time components of different levels of criticality - i.e. severity of failure - on the same processor, in order to obtain good resource utilisation. They must be able to guarantee deadlines of highly-critical threads without any dependence on less-critical threads. This requires strong temporal isolation, similar to the spatial isolation that is traditionally provided by operating systems, without unnecessary loss of processor utilisation. We present a model that uses scheduling contexts as first-class objects to represent time, and integrates seamlessly with the capability-based protection model of the seL4 microkernel. We show that the model comes with minimal overhead, and supports implementation of arbitrary scheduling policies as well as criticality switches at user level.},

We focus on system architecture models composed from libraries of components and complexity-reducing design patterns having formally verified properties. This allows new system designs to be developed rapidly using patterns that have been shown to reduce unnecessary complexity and coupling between components. Components and patterns are annotated with formal contracts describing their guaranteed behaviors and the contextual assumptions that must be satisfied for their correct operation. We describe the compositional reasoning framework that we have developed for proving the correctness of a system design, and provide a proof of the soundness of our compositional reasoning approach. An example based on an aircraft flight control system is provided to illustrate the method and supporting analysis tools.",

  abstract   = {Model-based systems engineering approaches support the early adoption of a model - a collection of abstractions - of the system under development. The system model can be augmented with key properties of the system including formal specifications of system behavior that codify portions of system and unit-level requirements. There are obvious gaps between the model with formally specified behavior and the deployed system. Previous work on component contract languages has shown how behavior can be specified in models defined using the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) - a SAE International standard (AS5506C). That work demonstrated the effectiveness of model-level formal methods specification and verification but did not provide a strong and direct connection to system implementations developed using conventional programming languages. In particular, there was no refinement of model-level contracts to programming language-level contracts nor a framework for formally verifying that program code conforms to model-level behavioral specifications.To address these gaps and to enable the practical application of model-contract languages for verification of deployed high-integrity systems, this paper describes the design of the GUMBO AADL contract language that integrates and extends key concepts from earlier contract languages. The GUMBO contract language (GCL) is closely aligned to a formal semantics of the AADL run-time framework, which provides a platform- and language- independent specification of AADL semantics. We have enhanced the HAMR AADL code generation framework to translate model-level contracts to programming language-level contracts in the Slang high-integrity language. We demonstrate how the Logika verification tool can automatically verify that Slang-based AADL component implementations conform to contracts, both at the code-level and model-level. Slang-based implementations of AADL systems can be executed directly or compiled to C for deployments on Linux or the seL4 verified microkernel.},

  abstract = {Reduction to satisfiability of constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) is a widely studied approach to automated program verification. Current CHC-based methods, however, do not work very well for pointer-manipulating programs, especially those with dynamic memory allocation. This article presents a novel reduction of pointer-manipulating Rust programs into CHCs, which clears away pointers and memory states by leveraging Rust’s guarantees on permission. We formalize our reduction for a simplified core of Rust and prove its soundness and completeness. We have implemented a prototype verifier for a subset of Rust and confirmed the effectiveness of our method.},
